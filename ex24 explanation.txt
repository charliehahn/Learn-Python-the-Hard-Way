Replaced is kind of it, but really it's being "passed" to secret_formula. Think about it like you have a friend and you give them $5. You call the $5 "lunch_money", but your friend calls the $5 "bread_money". It's still the same money, you two just have different names for it.
In this case, the variable start_point is currently set to some value, and when secret_formula(start_point) is called, the function secret_formula() also gets to refer to that value. When secret_formula() exits then it's reference to the variable disappears, leaving the start_point reference.
Now, what I recommend is put some print(">>>> in secret_formula, started=", started) at the top of secret_formula(), and then also print out the variables being passed to it each time you call it. Then you'll see what's going on rather than having to imagine it in your head.
